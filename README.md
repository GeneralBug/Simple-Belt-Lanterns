# Simple Belt Lanterns
###### Based on https://github.com/FabricMC/fabric-example-mod

Simple Fabric mod allowing you to equip lanterns in the Trinket belt slot. Requires [Trinkets](https://modrinth.com/mod/trinkets), [Radiant Gear](https://modrinth.com/mod/radiant-gear) and a compatible dynamic light mod like [LambDynamicLights](https://modrinth.com/mod/lambdynamiclights). I plan to add rendering soon.

Currently supports lanterns from:
 - Twigs
 - Pigsteel
 - Galosphere
 - Ribbits
 - Additional Lanterns

Also you can build in compatibility with your own mod by simply tagging the item under c:lanters or c:soul_lanterns. Otherwise, please suggest more for me to add :)
